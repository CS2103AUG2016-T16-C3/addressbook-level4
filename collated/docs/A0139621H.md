#### Use case: Aliasing command keyword

**MSS**

1. User requests to change the keyword of a command.
2. Task Manager modifies the corresponding command's old keyword to the new one. <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The old command that was entered is invalid.

> 2a1. User is notified that the command word is invalid. <br>
Use case ends.

2b. The new command keyword is already in use by another command.

> 2b1. User is notified as such, and is shown which command is using this keyword. <br>
Use case ends.

#### Use case: Storage command

**MSS**

1. User requests to change the storage path and/or filename of the Task Manager.
2. Task Manager modifies the storage path and/or filename accordingly.
3. Task Manager also updates the filepath at the bottom of the UI. <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The new filepath entered is invalid.

> 2a1. User is notified that the filepath is invalid. <br>
Use case ends.

2b. The new filepath entered is unaccessible.

> 2b1. User is notified that the filepath cannot be used and is thus invalid. <br>
User case ends.

2c. The filename entered is already in use.

> 2c1. User is notified that any changes to the new file will overwrite that of the old one. <br>
User case resumes at step 3

#### Use case: Undo

**MSS**

1. User requests to undo an action.
2. Task manager undos the user's previous action and displays what was undone. <br>
Use case ends.

> 2a1. User is notified as such. <br>
Use case ends.

<a id="done"></a>
#### Ticking off tasks: `done`
_Perhaps the most satisfying command! Let's you mark a task as done._<br>
Format: `done <task number>`

> Task number specifies which out of the tasks on the screen you wish to tick off

Examples:
 * `done 1`
 * `done 3`


<a id="undo"></a>
#### Undo previous action: `undo`
_Made a mistake? Fret not! Just use this keyword to revert the last action that you did!_<br>
Format: `undo`

> * Can be used more than once. <br>
> * Cannot be used if you close TaskNinja and reopen it; the temporary history of commands that you use will be cleared and there will be nothing for TaskNinja to undo. <br>
> * The commands that you can undo are: add, edit, delete and alias
> * All extension commands cannot be undone, by default.

Example:
  * `undo`


<a id="sortby"></a>
#### Sortby: `sortby`
_Sorts your task list either by time, or by priority._<br>
Format: `sortby time/priority`

> Even if priority or time have been aliased, this command will still use the words priority and time

Examples:
  * `sortby time`
  * `sortby priority`


<a id="storage"></a>
#### Specify a storage folder: `storage`
_Allows you to edit the storage file._<br>
Format: `storage <path/to/file/fileName.xml>`

> The file's name must have a .xml extension. <br>

Example:
  * `storage data/TaskNinja.xml`

# Appendix A
_This appendix lists down all the inputs of dates and times that are accepted when adding/editing a task._<br>
_As we are using PrettyTime parser to read in dates and times, we strongly recommend you to follow this table in order to let you have the best experience when using Task Ninja!_<br>
_You may also refer to the examples in [Event](#from-to), [At](#at) and [By](#by) sections for an overview of how to input your dates and times when adding/editing your task._<br>

> * The current time will be timestamped to your tasks should you only enter a date and no time.
> * The following examples use Wed 19 Oct 12:00:00 2016 as the current time and date, unless otherwise specified
