_You may also refer to the examples in [Event](#from-to) and [Before](#before) sections for an overview of how to input your dates and times when adding/editing your task._<br>

`1` | Wed Oct 19 01:00:00 | Just a single number is ambiguous and should be avoided
`00` | Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 | Similarly, just `00` is also ambiguous
`19/10` | Wed Oct 19 19:00:00 | Read not as a date, but as 1900 hours - remember to use MM/DD
`19/10/16` | Wed Oct 19 19:00:00 | Same as above
`19/10/2016` | Wed Oct 19 19:00:00 | Same as above
`23 Feb 17` | Tue Feb 23 16:00:00 2016 | Without the apostrophe before `16`, it's read incorrectly
`23 Feb 1400` | Mon Feb 23 12:00:00 1400 | `1400` is read in as an year instead of time
`next next week` | Wed Oct 26 12:00:00 | The second `next` is ignored
`the day after` | Cannot be read | Add in a tomorrow, and we can read it :)
`the following day` | Cannot be read |
`the week after` | Cannot be read |
