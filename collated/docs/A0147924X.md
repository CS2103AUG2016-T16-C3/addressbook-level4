## Introduction

Task Ninja is a task manager with a command line interface. It is aimed at users who prefer to only use the keyboard and prefer to be able to add tasks with one line of information.<br>

This guide describes how Task Ninja has been designed and implemented. It is directed at developers new to this application aiming to understand the architecture of the application and at more experienced developers aiming to refresh their knowledge of the application. It also provides a description of how you can set up the development environment. Finally, it includes User Stories, Use Cases, Non Functional Requirements and a Product Survey in the Appendix to give you a better idea of the pain points that this application is trying to solve.

### Logic component

<p align="center"><img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
<sub>Fig 5: Class Diagram for Logic component</sub></p>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic`,
* Uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command. The `Parser` class employs an `ExtensionParser` class to parse extensions into Task Properties.
* Executes the `Command` object returned by the `Parser` class.
* Encapsulates the result of the command execution as a `CommandResult` object and passes it back to the `UI`.

> The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add Name")` API call.<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="images/AddTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>
<sub>Fig 6: Sequence Diagram for Add command in Logic component</sub></p>

#### Low-level details about the Logic Component

Undo Command:<br>
The `Command` class keeps a static stack of `UndoableCommand` objects. Every time an `UndoableCommand` is successfully executed, it is added to this stack. When the user wishes to undo an action, an element is popped off the stack, and this command is undone.<br>

Link between `Parser` and `Model`:<br>
The `UserPrefs` object in the model (see [`Model`](#model-component)) stores the command keywords. The `Parser` object keeps a reference to these keywords, so that it can parse commands entered by the user.


### Model component

<p align="center"><img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>
<sub>Fig 7: Class Diagram for Model component</sub></p>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Task Manager data.
* Exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list so that the `UI` automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### Low-level details about the Model Component

TaskProperty:<br>
This is an abstract class that all the task properties (like venue and description) inherit from. It provides most of the API that TaskProperty objects need to expose to other classes. These API are sometimes overridden by the subclasses, for example to provide their own version of a pretty string value (the string displayed on the UI).

# User Guide

* [Quick Start](#quick-start)
* [Features](#features)
  * [Primary Commands](#primary-commands)
    * [Extensions](#extensions)
* [Cheat Sheet](#cheat-sheet)
* [Appendix A](#appendix-a)



## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `taskninja.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Task Ninja.

3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

4. To communicate with Task Ninja, type a command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

5. Some commands to get you started:
  * `help` : Bring up the help page.
  * `add Dinner with Mum` : Add a task `Dinner with Mum` to your list.
  * `find Dinner` : Finds all the tasks containing the word `Dinner`.
  * `delete 3` : Delete the 3rd task as visible in the current list.



## Features

### Overview
Task Ninja uses some [primary commands](#primary-commands), like `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `find`. Some of these commands, like `add` and `edit`, can then be made more specific using [extensions](#extensions), such as `at`, `by`, `from-to` and `priority`. <br>

This means that the primary commands are used in conjunction with extensions to give the manager more information about what you want to do. <br>

For example, you could edit the venue of the 1st task displayed by typing `edit 1 venue Home`.

> The order of extensions is not fixed.

### Notation used:
`[]`: These square brackets represent optional argument(s)<br>
`<>`: These angular brackets should be replaced with what you wish to enter, eg. an actual time if it says `<time>` <br>

### Primary Commands

<a id="help"></a>
#### Viewing help: `help`
_Overwhelmed by the amazingness of Task Ninja? `help` is here to help you discover more._<br>

Format: `help [<command>]`

> This shows help for all commands (In fact it opens this User Guide)<br>
> If a command is specified, then it shows help for that command only

Examples:
  * `help`
  * `help add`
  * `help delete`


<a id="add"></a>
#### Adding a task to the list: `add`
_The most basic command... let's start adding tasks to the manager._<br>
Format: `add <task description> [<extensions>]`

> * Task description outlines the task to be added. <br>
> * Extensions allow specifying more details about the task, such as deadlines and venues. <br>
> * Without any time information, the task will be added as a task without a time (a floating task). <br>

Examples:
  * `add Dinner with Arthur`
  * `add Elope with Guinevere`


<a id="extensions"></a>
#### Extensions
_But now you're probably wondering... what extensions can I use? How do they help me?
Well to answer that, let's just dive straight into our extensions:_<br>

<a id="venue"></a>
##### At a certain venue: `venue`
_Going to university but somehow ended up wandering at the mall aimlessly? Remember your destination with this extension._<br>
Format: `venue <description of venue>`

Examples:
  * `add Lunch with Arthur venue Avalon`
  * `add Date with Girlfriend venue Romantic spot`


<a id="from-to"></a>

> * Start time/date indicates when the task/event begins, end time/date indicates when the task/event finishes. <br>
> * A list of supported time and date inputs are listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a). You may also refer to the examples for a brief guide. <br>

Examples:
  * `add Meeting with Boss from 11am to 1pm`

##### Combining multiple extensions
_Extensions can be used together for maximum flexibility. This means that you can add complex tasks using commands as natural as:_
