## Introduction

Task Ninja is a task manager with a command line interface. It is aimed at users who prefer to only use the keyboard and prefer to be able to add tasks with one line of information.<br>

This guide describes how Task Ninja has been designed and implemented. It is directed at developers new to this application aiming to understand the architecture of the application and at more experienced developers aiming to refresh their knowledge of the application. It also provides a description of how you can set up the development environment. Finally, it includes User Stories, Use Cases, Non Functional Requirements and a Product Survey in the Appendix to give you a better idea of the pain points that this application is trying to solve.

* [Appendix A](#appendix-a)



## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `taskninja.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Task Ninja.

3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

4. To communicate with Task Ninja, type a command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

5. Some commands to get you started:
  * `help` : Bring up the help page.
  * `add Dinner with Mum` : Add a task `Dinner with Mum` to your list.
  * `find Dinner` : Finds all the tasks containing the word `Dinner`.
  * `delete 3` : Delete the 3rd task as visible in the current list.



## Features

### Overview
Task Ninja uses some [primary commands](#primary-commands), like `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `find`. Some of these commands, like `add` and `edit`, can then be made more specific using [extensions](#extensions), such as `at`, `by`, `from-to` and `priority`. <br>

This means that the primary commands are used in conjunction with extensions to give the manager more information about what you want to do. <br>

For example, you could edit the venue of the 1st task displayed by typing `edit 1 venue Home`.

> The order of extensions is not fixed.

### Notation used:
`[]`: These square brackets represent optional argument(s)<br>
`<>`: These angular brackets should be replaced with what you wish to enter, eg. an actual time if it says `<time>` <br>

### Primary Commands

<a id="help"></a>
#### Viewing help: `help`
_Overwhelmed by the amazingness of Task Ninja? `help` is here to help you discover more._<br>

Format: `help [<command>]`

> This shows help for all commands (In fact it opens this User Guide)<br>
> If a command is specified, then it shows help for that command only

Examples:
  * `help`
  * `help add`
  * `help delete`


<a id="add"></a>
#### Adding a task to the list: `add`
_The most basic command... let's start adding tasks to the manager._<br>
Format: `add <task description> [<extensions>]`

> * Task description outlines the task to be added. <br>
> * Extensions allow specifying more details about the task, such as deadlines and venues. <br>

Examples:
  * `add Dinner with Arthur`
  * `add Elope with Guinevere`


<a id="extensions"></a>
#### Extensions
_But now you're probably wondering... what extensions can I use? How do they help me?
Well to answer that, let's just dive straight into our extensions:_<br>

<a id="venue"></a>
##### At a certain venue: `venue`
_Going to university but somehow ended up wandering at the mall aimlessly? Remember your destination with this extension._<br>
Format: `venue <description of venue>`

Examples:
  * `add Lunch with Arthur venue Avalon`
  * `add Date with Girlfriend venue Romantic spot`


<a id="from-to"></a>
##### Events that last for a certain period of time: `from-to`
_Mark tasks/events that will be done over a certain period of time._<br>
Format: `from <start time> to <end time>`

> * Start time/date indicates when the task/event begins, end time/date indicates when the task/event finishes. <br>
> * A list of supported time and date inputs are listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a). You may also refer to the examples for a brief guide. <br>

Examples:
  * `add Meeting with Boss from 11am to 1pm`

##### Combining multiple extensions
_Extensions can be used together for maximum flexibility. This means that you can add complex tasks using commands as natural as:_

  * `add Appointment with dentist at 5:30pm venue Bright Teeth Clinic`


_Alright! Armed with these extensions, let's take a look at some other primary commands that help enhance your experience with Task Ninja._

<a id="find"></a>
#### Searching for tasks: `find`
_Forgotten when you arranged that date? Use `find`!_<br>
Format: `find [<description>] [<extensions>]`

> * For matching against description and venue:
    * The search is case insensitive
    * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Tutorial CS2103T` will match `CS2103T Tutorial`.
    * Only full words will be matched e.g. `2103T` will not match `CS2103T`.
    * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `Dinner` will match `Dinner with Mum`.

Examples:
  * `find Tutorial`<br>
    Shows all tasks containing `Tutorial` in the description.
  * `find venue Room Home`<br>

> * Fields for the specified extensions will be changed. <br>

Examples:
  * `edit 1 Dinner with Guinevere tag Romantic`
  * `edit 2 at 1am 3 Oct`
  * `edit 1 Dinner with Guinevere venue Under the stars`


<a id="delete"></a>
#### Deleting tasks: `delete`
_Added a task you don't need? Fear not, for delete is here._<br>
