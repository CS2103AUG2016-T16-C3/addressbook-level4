## Introduction

Task Ninja is a task manager with a command line interface. It is aimed at users who prefer to only use the keyboard and prefer to be able to add tasks with one line of information.<br>

This guide describes how Task Ninja has been designed and implemented. It is directed at developers new to this application aiming to understand the architecture of the application and at more experienced developers aiming to refresh their knowledge of the application. It also provides a description of how you can set up the development environment. Finally, it includes User Stories, Use Cases, Non Functional Requirements and a Product Survey in the Appendix to give you a better idea of the pain points that this application is trying to solve.

* [Appendix A](#appendix-a)



## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `taskninja.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Task Ninja.

3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

4. To communicate with Task Ninja, type a command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

5. Some commands to get you started:
  * `help` : Bring up the help page.
  * `add Dinner with Mum` : Add a task `Dinner with Mum` to your list.
  * `find Dinner` : Finds all the tasks containing the word `Dinner`.
  * `delete 3` : Delete the 3rd task as visible in the current list.



## Features

### Overview
Task Ninja uses some [primary commands](#primary-commands), like `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `find`. These commands can then be made more specific using [extensions](#extensions), such as `at`, `before`, `from-to` and `priority`. <br>

This means that the primary commands are used in conjunction with extensions to give the manager more information about what you want to do. <br>

For example, you could edit the venue of the 1st task displayed by typing `edit 1 at Home`.

> The order of extensions is not fixed.

### Notation used:
`[]`: These square brackets represent optional argument(s)<br>
`<>`: These angular brackets should be replaced with what you wish to enter, eg. an actual time if it says `<time>` <br>

### Primary Commands

<a id="help"></a>
#### Viewing help: `help`
_Overwhelmed by the amazingness of Task Ninja? `help` is here to help you discover more._<br>

Format: `help`

<a id="add"></a>
#### Adding a task to the list: `add`
_The most basic command... let's start adding tasks to the manager._<br>
Format: `add <task description> [<extensions>]`

> * Task description outlines the task to be added. <br>
> * Extensions allow specifying more details about the task, such as deadlines and venues. <br>
> * Without any time information, the task will be added as a task without a time (a floating task). <br>

Examples:
  * `add Dinner with Arthur`
  * `add Dinner with Arthur venue Avalon from 8:30pm to 9:30pm`
  * `add Finish 2103T Tutorial before 11:59pm`

#### Searching for tasks: `find`
_Forgotten when you arranged that date? Use `find`!_<br>
Format: `find <keywords> [<more keywords>]`

> * The search is case sensitive. e.g `dinner` will not match `Dinner`.
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Tutorial CS2103T` will match `CS2103T Tutorial`.
> * Only the description is searched for.
> * Only full words will be matched e.g. `2103T` will not match `CS2103T`.
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `Dinner` will match `Dinner with Mum`.
