**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/Ui.java)

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `TagListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`. Moreover, their actions can be captured and managed by `UiManager`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these `UI` parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/manager/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI`,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the `UI` can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the `UI` accordingly.

#### Low-level details about the UI Component

Relationship between tagList and taskList: <br>
The tagList inside `TagListPanel` contains all the tags that taskList has. Whenever there are some changes to the taskList, the tagList will do the same operations to the tags of the changing tasks if they are present.

Respective taskList will show up if their tag is clicked: <br>
When user click on a specific tag, it will raise up an event called `TagPanelSelectionChangedEvent`, and this event will be handled by `handleTagListPanelSelectionChangedEvent` in `ModelManager` and tasks without the tag clicked will be filtered out and tasks with the tag will remain there.
